# Dog Party

## Project Overview
This is my first coding project from week on of Turing. The goal was to build a website with HTML and CSS to match a comp provided to us from the school here <http://frontend.turing.io/projects/dog-party-js-edition.html> with the option to try some JavaScript to change part of the H1 to text the user enters into the input form and to make the site mobile friendly. 
-My biggest win was how well I set up the HTML on day one, I put all the content on the page right away and seperated everything into groups based on where they would show up in the page. 
-The biggest problem I ran into was positioning most of the content on the page, I started with mostly margin auto's and margin top's but ran into problems with margin collapse and I ended up finding that if I changed margin auto to margin left, I could still center things but my vertical margin would not be effected by it. I could not find any documentation of this kind of margin collapse but after turning things on and off in Dev Tools enough I found that turning off the margin auto would allow the vertical margin to work again so I tried margin left and here we are!
-One thing I wish I knew before I started was to put a small border around everything on the page to keep an idea of where everything is. I eventually heard of this idea from a mod 2 student and it helped the layout of the site make a lot more sense.
